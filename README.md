# Beyond Citrus Greening: Code Replication

## Description

This repository contains all the necessary code and data to replicate the findings presented in the paper "Beyond Citrus Greening: Technological Breakthrough and the Biological, Economic and Social Implications." The purpose of this repository is to provide transparency and allow for replication of our results.

## Computational Requirements

### Software Requirements

Before running the code, please ensure that you have the following software installed:

- R (version x.x or higher)
- RStudio (recommended for running R scripts)
- Python (version x.x or higher)

### R Package Dependencies

To run the codes in R, several packages need to be installed. Here's the list of required R packages:

- package1
- package2
- package3
- ...

You can install these packages in R using the command `install.packages("packageName")`.

### Python Package Dependencies

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scipy
- ...

You can install these packages using pip: `pip install packageName`.

## Instructions to Replicate the Results

1. Clone the Repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`

2. Navigate to the Repository Directory:  
   `cd yourrepository`

3. Data Setup:  
   (Instructions on how to set up or access the data.)

4. Running the Analysis:  
   - For R scripts: Open the `.R` files in RStudio and run.
   - For Python scripts: Run the `.py` files using a Python IDE or from the command line with `python filename.py`.

## Visualization

(Instructions or scripts for generating visualizations related to the paper. This could include plots, charts, or other graphical representations of the data and results.)

(You can also include examples of expected outputs, or screenshots of visualizations.)
